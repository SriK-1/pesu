BiblioTrack is a Library Management System designed for librarians, featuring a user-friendly GUI made using Tkinter. It manages books, student records, and transaction logs using CSV files, enabling efficient book issuance, returns, and inventory management. It is the result of team effort for a class python hackathon after we just finished learning the basics of python. 

Features:

Data Storage: Utilizes books.csv, students.csv, and logs.csv for data management.
Core Classes: Includes Book and Student classes for handling records, along with a Librarian class for all operations.
GUI Components: Provides sections for book and student management with search functionality and transaction forms.

Functionalities:

Search and display books and students.
Issue and return books with eligibility checks.
Calculate penalties for late returns.

Getting Started: 

Clone the repository, install Python, and run the main application file to start using BiblioTrack.
